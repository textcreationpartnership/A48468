            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41783:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 67 -->fellow-ſtanding Laws; to contradict, alter, or repeal any of them, more then it hath power to deſtroy its own being.</p>
            <p>And the moſt learned Judges when they would give the greateſt reſpect unto them, have been wont to tell the People, That they are ſo Ancient that no Man knows the beginning of them; ſo Juſt in themſelves, and ſo approved in all times by our Anceſtors, that they frequently adventured their lives, and freely ſpent their bloods to preſerve them from Violation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation; being, as it ſhould ſeem, a Compact of the firſt Poſſeſſors of the Land, binding Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Poſterity to the unalterable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of them: which they might well doe, conſidering that it was a Law in it ſelf ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as that at this day no conſiderable inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience can be ſhewed therein; but where any alteration hath been made, though by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it can be manifeſtly proved to be ever for the worſe.</p>
            <p>Like unto that alteration mentioned by Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> page 74. of 2 <hi>part. Inſtitut.</hi> where he ſaith, <q>by the Common Law, to avoid all extortion and Grievance of the Subject, no She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, Coroner, Jayler, or other of the Kings mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ought to take any reward for doing his Office, but only of the King upon penalty. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that this Rule of the comon Law was alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it is incredible what extortions &amp; oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have thereupon enſued; ſo dangerous a thing it is to ſhake or alter any of the Rules or Fundamentall points of the Common Law:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41783:2"/>

            </p>
            <p>Such, &amp; ſo miſchievous for the moſt part, have bin the fruits of Parliament alterations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations upon our ancient Lawes and Rights: And which occaſioned the ſame learned Author magnifying the 29 Chapter of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> for binding in all cauſes to Tryals by Juries: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly to cry out thus, <q>Againſt this Ancient Fundamentall Law and in the face thereof; I finde an Act of Parliament made</q> (as deeming it a moſt wicked and impudent thing) and when he hath largely ſet forth the foulneſs thereof in the Caſes of <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudly,</hi> he purſues it thus moſt effectually, <hi rend="margQuotes">That the ill ſucceſs therof, and the fearfull Ends of thoſe two Oppreſſors, ſhould deterr others from committing the like</hi> (that is, executing of unlawfull Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment though unrepealed) for that was their Crime, for which they were indicted, and were found Traytors, and ſuffred death accordingly) <hi rend="margQuotes">And ſhould admoniſh Parliaments, that inſtead of this ordinary and precious Tryall by the law of the Land (that is by Juries) they bring not in abſolute and partiall Tryals by diſcretion:</hi> by which arbitrary rule and no other, the late long Parliament (nevertheleſs adjudged Mr <hi>Lilburne</hi>) than which nothing can be more groſly contrary to the Common Law of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>Which being an Act in all reſpects contrary to the known Law of the Land, being either groundleſs (for in the Act none are expreſt) or grounded only on their moſt illegal Arbitrary proceedings with him: or rather upon his name, for they never judged him in perſon at all: now this being an act of Parliament (if it can be proved a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) contrary to the fundamental common and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laws of England, is no other but a void Law and ſuch as is no warrantable rule to the good men of England to judge by, or finde any man of Mr. Lilburnes name guilty thereupon: and if any ſhould be ſo unadviſed, or ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, and unconſcionable as to finde him guilty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and be the occaſion of his death <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And though at preſent they may ſee no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and may think the times may beare them out: yet as thats no cure for a conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared with innocent blood, ſo is there no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity can be given for ſubverting the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws of <hi>England,</hi> in a Caſe of murther, all good men being bound to proſecute.</p>
            <p>And that this is a void Law appears yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in that it is grounded upon; and is in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of a Judgement given in Parliament in way of puniſhment of a fact, that was never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore known, or declared by any Law to be a Crime, whereby Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> or any other could be warned from the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now that all Laws of this Nature,<note place="margin">

            <p>And the reaſon is evident, for if there ſhould be no firm, ſtanding and eſtabliſhed unalterable Law which Parliaments, Juries and all people were bound to maintain, no man could be certain of any thing belonging to his perſon, life, eſtate, wife, children, family, conſcience, religion, good name, no, not for an houre; for what aſſurance hath he, but that a Parliament are in this inſtant is making alterations in ſome of theſe, and every day and hour changing, and that dangerouſly,

               <!-- PDF PAGE 69 -->as the moſt godly men found in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, and too many ſince; though ſcarce any upon ſo known a ſlight accompt as Mr. <hi>Lilburns,</hi> whoſe caſe yet is every mans caſe; for by the ſame rule that they enacted him a felon, in caſe he returned: They might as juſtly have enacted baniſhment to every one that ſhould twiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the payment of his Taxes, and make it Felony if he returned: And how ſoon this and worſe may be done, if Jury-men will but give encouragement, by finding Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> Guilty of Felony: Let every wiſe man judge in time, and be more wiſe, then by ſo doing, involve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and poſterity in blood and ſlavery.</p>
            <p>Now ſuch Laws as theſe being void Laws, who are to know them to be ſuch but chiefly Juries, who are the only Legal Tryers of all men in all cauſes, &amp; they are bound in conſcience to try all Laws made by Parliament, by the Fundamental Laws; and where they finde them contrary, and that men ſtand before them to be tryed as Felons upon thoſe Laws, they are bound in conſcience to pronounce them not guilty: That is no Felons, nor in the leaſt deſerving death, as in Mr. <hi>Lilburns</hi> caſe, and not to expect the Direction of Judges and Recorders in the caſe, who many of them lie under ſore temptations of loſing their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and places of profit, in caſe they wreſt not judgement to the wils of thoſe that are in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: but you are to keepe a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to ſtick cloſe to the Ancient ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law, as to that which will ſtand you in ſtead, and preſerve you being innocent againſt the greateſt and moſt powerful upon earth.

            <p>Much you know may be ſaid, to prove the makers of the Act before you, no Parliament; no more a Parliament, then you would deem that a Commoncouncel of London, when the major part were excluded per force. In which caſe you would think it ſtrange, that Acts made by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor part ſhould be binding to the City, or any one Citizen; 'tis all a caſe; and thoſe that have any underſtanding cannot but know it; and their conſciences will put them in mind of it when they ſhall be moſt unwilling: thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry men that excluded the major part, declaring that they did not look upon the remaining party as a competent judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory to make Laws; but as perſons reſerved in order to a new Parliament to be ſpeedily choſen.</p>
            <p>And for further illuſtration, you know, though a full Comoncouncel may lawfully make Acts of Commoncoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel for the better government of the City; yet if they make any contrary to the Charter and antient Cuſtom of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is a void Act: and being ſo pleaded, hath ſo proved; and by Juries hath been given againſt the plaintiff there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. Now as the City hath ſtanding Laws, ſo much more hath the Nation: and though the Commoncouncel of the Nation may poſſibly have a power of making Laws in ſome caſes; yet as they muſt not be buſi-bodies which have confounded all, ſo muſt they be ſure to make none contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the ſtanding Laws: or if they do, they are to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for none, and void Laws, by the good men of England, who are the ſtrong out-guards and Fortreſſes of the Laws and Liberties of England, and muſt not betray their truſt, for any reaſon whatſoever; there being a certaine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
